Front End Nanodegree Exercises

## Project: Build a Portfolio Site

### Instructions as stated in the course materials:

- Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section (in the lower right hand corner of your screen, just below this text) and review it.
- Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
- Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
- Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
- Validate your HTML and CSS against the W3C's Validators. Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:
- HTML5: Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.
- CSS3: Property [some property here] is an unknown vendor extension when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).

### Additional Info

In addtion to the coursework, HTML, and CSS I used the Bootstrap4 framework via CDN.
Placeholder images were taken from [PEXEL](https://www.pexels.com/).
